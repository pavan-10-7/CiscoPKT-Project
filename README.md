# CiscoPKT-Project
#Enterprise Networking Project (Cisco Packet Tracer)
#📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an Enterprise Network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
It follows a Hierarchical Network Design model (Core, Distribution, and Access layers) and integrates enterprise-grade technologies for scalability, security, and manageability.

The network is designed for a multi-floor enterprise environment with VLANs for departmental segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, centralized services (DHCP, DNS, Email), and Internet access through ISPs.

#🛠️ Technologies Implemented

Hierarchical Network Design (Core / Distribution / Access layers)

VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing (Switch Virtual Interfaces - SVIs)

DHCP Server for dynamic IP allocation

DNS & Email Servers for enterprise services

NAT Overload (PAT) for Internet access via ISPs

Access Control Lists (ACLs) for traffic filtering and security

Port Security on Switches

Wireless LAN (WLAN) with Access Point configuration for tablets/laptops

Static IPv4 addressing for servers and routers

Redundant ISP Connectivity for external communication

#📂 Requirements

Cisco Packet Tracer (Version 8.x or higher recommended)

Basic to Intermediate Networking Knowledge, including:

VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing

DHCP, DNS, and Email Services

Routing Protocols & NAT

ACLs and Security Configurations

#🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Enterprise-Networking-PT.git


Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Review the network topology and device configurations.

Test connectivity using commands such as:

ping (end-to-end communication)

ipconfig (check assigned IPs)

nslookup <domain> (verify DNS resolution)
